##[ANN][CDN] Canada eCoin | Merge Mineable Scrypt | Takeover
August 25th, 2015; announcement located at https://github.com/Canada-eCoin/announcements/ann-cdn-e08-25-2015.md

The Canada eCoin project developers are in the process of bringing together applications to serve as a general forum, consensus gathering, and ecoin distribution as well as updating the core of Canada eCoin to include bug fixes from our mother-coin, https://litecoin.org/. 

We plan to create the Canada eCoin Foundation for the tracking of projects, people and funding and we will be asking the users of the Canada eCoin to vote forward the features and structure of the organization.  We will be encouraging all users to join the Canada eCoin Foundation as it will serve as a body for our unified voice.

Details of our specific applications and time-lines are unpublished because they shuffle and change depending on funding/manpower.  As the foundation gets established all of these details will become public knowledge and consensus driven.  We appreciate your patience as we are all family oriented employees who donate their time to do this work out of the goodness of our hearts.  We see a day where the developers of the Canada eCoin project are funded by our projects but today is not one.

## We are working for free now so our children can be free later.

## What has happened so far:
* A group of nerdy geeks from Hespeler (Ontario, Canada) called GigaGeeks (http://www.gigageek.ca/) decided to breathe some life into the Canada eCoin project (Q1-2015)
	- Watched and poked around trying to find others involved; failed
	- todo.ourcoin.ca was acquired and a published 'birds eye view' of a work-path for expanding blockchain technology into service delivery using the Canada eCoin and Ethereum as public ledgers with the intention of creating GigaGeek DAO, a peer-to-peer service delivery platform which will be publicly owned using a third blockchain (Asset, GigaGeek Peer Share)
	- A small dedicated group was forged to oversee the big picture and keep a live boundary between the Canada eCoin core projects and 3rd party usage (ie, GigaGeek's decentralized autonomous organization).
* Canadaecoin.ca.net.com domain names were acquired by Jason (koad) Zvaniga (owner & operator of GigaGeek Industries, a digital living concierge and consultancy company)  
	- Simple website published with links to wallets/github/bleutrade
* 2 dedicated servers brought online to host seeds/electrum/pool/robots
* Ircbot is alive in #OurCoin and #CanadaeCoin on Freenode
* 2 electrum servers are alive on ontario.canadaecoin.net and alberta.canadaecoin.net
* Updates to the QT 
	- Launch of Testnet
	- UI finishing/enhancements
	- Added checkpoints
* pool.canadaecoin.ca is alive for Canada eCoin mining
	
## What is about to happen:
* Continuing updates to QT and Core
	- Realignment to core codebase (Litecoin) on github
	- Evaluation and merge of each pull request since original fork (dec 2013)
* Add CDN into Coinomi (Universal Bitcoin Wallet, http://coinomi.com/) & the launch of two Mercury Servers (more Electrum)
* Development of the community's social network
	- (OurCoin.ca) Using BitVote (https://bitvote.github.io/) and Ethereum (https://www.ethereum.org/) for consensus gathering
	- Using Physical Challenge Coins for rewards to contributors (and on/off-line verification)
	- Using a Twitter Robot to engage users and give away Canada eCoins (@CanadaeCoin)
* Launch of http://downloads.canadaecoin.ca/ - a place to get compiled versions of Canada eCoin code including past releases, major operating systems and versions as they become available.
* Launch of The Canada eCoin Wiki: http://wiki.canadaecoin.ca/
* Publish and polish platform-specific installation documentation

## What about after that?:
* As soon as we have our voting system in place, we will be able to decide more as a group.  
* We will be available to help 3rd party developers build apps that integrate into Canada eCoin and similar bitcoin technology
* We will make available examples of code and processes to those who want to learn bitcoin technology
* We already have a small dedicated team that is prepared to take on the challenges of maintaining an open-source cryptography project and we are open to add members to the team.  
* The overall goal here is to give Canada a platform to create tremendous change throughout society as a whole and we could use all kinds of different people's help; not just geeks and nerds.  

## Future home of the Canada eCoin Foundation - http://thisis.ourcoin.ca
