##How to register your nickname with Freenode


Freenode is the network that the Canada eCoin  chat room is hosted on. You have to register your nickname before you can use the tipbot in our rooms.

This is how you register your nickname:   
1. Pick a nickname, and connect. Make sure you have a nickname that you can remember the next time you log in.  (If you want to change it after you have connected already, type /nick YourNewNickname)   
2. Type '/msg nickserv register YourPassword you@example.com' into the text box of the chat — including the slash at the beginning, and replace the password and email address with something you select.   
3. Check your email, you will have recieved instructions to verify your email with freenode.   


Thats it!   
Now any time you connect to freenode you will have to issue the command '/msg nickserv identify YourPassword' before you can start gaining Canada eCoin's or withdraw from the tipbot.
